## Demo

## In-Progress!

This is a project being funded by Portland Community College to be completed end of summer 2023.  I'm happy to take suggestions and pull-requests, but please don't use this in production code yet.  The goal is to make it free and open-source, but licensing is currently pending.  The intent is for it to be used in authoring online, OER (open educational resource), _accessible_ textbooks.  

## Plans

- Looking at using the interpreted LaTeX to populate alttext attribute on mathml. [alttext reference](https://w3c.github.io/mathml-core/#the-top-level-math-element)
