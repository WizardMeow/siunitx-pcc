# Speech

## Units problem

MathJax with Speech-Rule-Engine does a fantastic job of creating speech in multiple 
languages for equations.  There is *some* support for units by adding the `MathML-Unit` 
class to the `<mi>` tag (via \class{} in LaTeX format).  However, it's limited.  
Not every unit is represented.  One option would be to expand the unit list in the
Speech-Rule-Engine repo.  However, there are other limitations.  When reading out
compound units, it is read as a mathematical equation using words like 'divided by' 
or 'start fraction __ over __ end fraction'.  A more accepted way to read units
is '__ per __'.


Examples with units represented in plain LaTeX and how they are translated for a 
screen reader:
plain LaTeX | speech generated by MathJax                           | interpreted LaTeX via siunitx
---|---|---
kg/s        | kilograms divided by seconds                          | \kilogram\per\second 
kg s^{-1}   | kilograms seconds superscript negative one            | \kilogram\per\second
\frac{kg}{s} | start fraction kilograms over seconds end fraction   | \kilogram\per\second
lx^3 V T^3  | el ex cubed volts tons cubed                          | \cubic\lux\volt\tesla\cubed
H^{-5}      | aitch superscript negative five                       | \per\henry\tothe{5}

To Resolve:

siunitx provides authors several ways to format units.  The table lists the same 
unit three times,  yet formatted three different ways.  While the interpreted LaTeX
can be written different, it can also be written exactly the same way but adjusted
via options.  

- Is the formatting purely visual or does it provide meaning?  
- Would the author's initial interpreted LaTeX give the best meaning?  
- Can directly use the interpreted LaTeX as a shortcut for creating speech?  (localization would be needed of course)

## Numbers problem

In siunitx, numbers are formatted in many ways as well.  For ease of reading, the default
is to apply small spacing between groups of three numbers when the number is longer than 4 digits.
However, the speech generator treats the space as starting a new number.  But there are other problems:

- Spacing treated as new numbers
- Uncertainty with parentheses vs +- 
- Exponential notation
- Negative numbers as bracketed numbers
