# Speech

## Number spacing issue

"The practice of grouping digits in this way is a matter of choice; it 
is not always followed in certain specialized applications such as 
engineering drawings, financial statements and scripts to be 
*read by a computer*."

Adding spaces to the number using Unicode character x2009 (slimspace) 
causes speech-rule-engine (SRE) to add spaces to the number causing a 
number like 12345 (which looks like 12&#x2009;345) to be read 
as "twelve three hundred and fourty-five" instead of "twelve thousand 
three hundred and forty-five".  Adding literal commas in 
place of the spaces will generate the correct reading, but using 
commas is not correct according to the SI rules.

This happens when:
- MathJax parses LaTeX:  `12\,345`
- MathML is generated manually (\u2009 is unicode slimspace):
```
    <mn>12\u2009345</mn>
```
- Alternative MathML:
```
    <mrow>
        <mn>12</mn>
        <mo separator='true'>\u2009</mo>
        <mn>345</mn>
    </mrow>
```

Pure MathML using `<mn>12\u2009345</mn>` is the best because this 
does not generate any `<mo>` multiplication in MathSpeak.  However,
it is still not read properly. 


## Units problem

MathJax with Speech-Rule-Engine does a fantastic job of creating speech in multiple 
languages for equations.  There is *some* support for units by adding the `MathML-Unit` 
class to the `<mi>` tag (via \class{} in LaTeX format).  However, it's limited.  
Not every unit is represented.  One option would be to expand the unit list in the
Speech-Rule-Engine repo.  However, there are other limitations.  When reading out
compound units, it is read as a mathematical equation using words like 'divided by' 
or 'start fraction __ over __ end fraction'.  A more accepted way to read units
is '__ per __'.


Examples with units represented in plain LaTeX and how they are translated for a 
screen reader:
plain LaTeX | speech generated by MathJax                           | interpreted LaTeX via siunitx
---|---|---
kg/s        | kilograms divided by seconds                          | \kilogram\per\second 
kg s^{-1}   | kilograms seconds superscript negative one            | \kilogram\per\second
\frac{kg}{s} | start fraction kilograms over seconds end fraction   | \kilogram\per\second
lx^3 V T^3  | el ex cubed volts tons cubed                          | \cubic\lux\volt\tesla\cubed
H^{-5}      | aitch superscript negative five                       | \per\henry\tothe{5}

To Resolve:

siunitx provides authors several ways to format units.  The table lists the same 
unit three times,  yet formatted three different ways.  While the interpreted LaTeX
can be written different, it can also be written exactly the same way but adjusted
via options.  

- Is the formatting purely visual or does it provide meaning?  
- Would the author's initial interpreted LaTeX give the best meaning?  
- Can directly use the interpreted LaTeX as a shortcut for creating speech?  (localization would be needed of course)

## Numbers problem

In siunitx, numbers are formatted in many ways as well.  For ease of reading, the default
is to apply small spacing between groups of three numbers when the number is longer than 4 digits.
However, the speech generator treats the space as starting a new number.  But there are other problems:

- Spacing treated as new numbers
- Uncertainty with parentheses vs +- 
- Exponential notation
- Negative numbers as bracketed numbers
