# Proposal

MathJax with Speech-Rule-Engine do a fantastic job of creating speech in multiple 
languages for equations.  There is *some* support for units by adding the `MathML-Unit` 
class to the `<mi>` tag (via \class{} in LaTeX format).  However, it's limited.  
Not every unit is represented.  One option would be to expand the unit list in the
Speech-Rule-Engine repo.  However, there are other limitations.  When reading out
compound units, it is read as a mathematical equation using words like 'divided by' 
or 'start fraction __ over __ end fraction'.


Examples with units represented in plain LaTeX and how they are translated for a 
screen reader:
plain LaTeX | speech generated by MathJax                           | interpreted units via siunitx
---|---|---
kg/s        | kilograms divided by seconds                          | \kilogram\per\second 
kg s^{-1}   | kilograms seconds superscript negative one            | \kilogram\per\second
\frac{kg}{s} | start fraction kilograms over seconds end fraction   | \kilogram\per\second
lx^3 V T^3  | el ex cubed volts tons cubed                          | \cubic\lux\volt\tesla\cubed
H^{-5}      | aitch superscript negative five                       | \per\henry\tothe{5}
